Wakelock Detector To Optimize Battery Life In Android Devices

<p align="justify">
Battery Optimizer is an Android application that detects other Android applications which are holding 'Wakelocks' but are not performing any useful tasks. Such applications can drain the battery drastically. However, in this application, only user level process can be killed because killing system level applications can affect the Android Operating System.
